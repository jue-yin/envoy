    are not sent properly to clients.

new_features:
- area: access_log
  change: |
    added %RESPONSE_FLAGS_LONG% substitution string, that will output a pascal case string representing the response flags.
    The output response flags will correspond with %RESPONSE_FLAGS%, only with a long textual string representation.
- area: extension_discovery_service
  change: |
    added ECDS support for :ref:` downstream network filters<envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Filter.config_discovery>`.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Added support for logging upstream connection establishment duration in the
    :ref:`%COMMON_DURATION% <config_access_log_format_common_duration>` access log
    formatter operator. The following time points were added: ``%US_CX_BEG%``,
    ``%US_CX_END%``, ``%US_HS_END%``.
- area: golang
  change: |
    added http golang filter config destroy callback. When a config gets deleted from envoy, the go plugin calls the
    Destroy function on the config instance. config should implement the new
    github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/contrib/golang/common/go/api.Config interface, implementing the Destroy function.
